##Evaluation Notes

Evaluation was conducted at EEE and at School of Medicine lobby at Imperial College South Kensignton Campus, over the course of 2 afternoons.

26 responses were recorded. The population ranges from students to staff members and the general public.

Most of the people (>90% based on observation) were naturally curious about the robot. Several (about 7 of them) commented that the QBot looks interesting and actively approach the robot.
They are generally curious about how it works and it's cute child-like appearance.

The addition of face tracking and animated speech helps the robot appeal more to the evaluators. With the exception of 1 evaluator, the rest of them were actively engaged with the robot and responded to QBot (instead of to the laptop). 11 of them comment about how they like the way the QBot is so animated, and 3 of them went further and ask the observer (me) more about how the motion is programmed. 2 evaluators held QBot's hands while answering his questions. 1 of the evaluators found the face tracking creepy, but was still pleasantly amused by the robot following his gaze. 15 of them expressed observable level of intrigue when the robot looked at them.

Other than 2 of the evaluators who had relevant technical experience relating to speech recognition, it was observed that the evaluators find that the QBot is taking too long a time to respond. 1 of them commented that there should be a acknowledgement reply from QBot before proceeding with the next question. Around 10 of them over-estimated the ability of QBot and started chatting with it at the start, before the observer stepped in to explain the situation to them.

Speech recognition took significantly longer when the environment is noisy. This is due to the energy threshold used to determine if the speech has ended. A quick fix was made by asking the evaluators to switch off the microphone when they finished responding. A push-to-talk microphone will alleviate this problem greatly.
